Lamar plays out the last year of his contract this year, then takes the franchise tag for the next two years making 47-51 million per year each, then becoming an UFA just as Herbert, Burrow and possibly others get extensions that continue to push the limit of the QB contract. Other than injury he's guaranteed $120 million without signing anything, all while the market keeps getting more and more bloated when it's time to sign a long term contract. 

I can realistically see him doing this then signing a 5 year $300 Million contract. He says he wants to be a billionaire - well this strategy would basically put him halfway there, and he's only 32 by the end of the 5 year contract."

NOT_MCAFEE,What is going on with John McAfee's death and a supposed dead man switch file dump being released?,"Was scrolling through reddit (on /r/all I think) and a thread about this popped up.

* This is all to do with information John McAfee said he collected prior to his death and had set up a dead-man's hand switch to release it if he died.
* There is a supposed file dump which needs to be unencrypted. 
* There's also some links to e-currency, but I don't know enough about that to know if that's what it is - I just see mention of some type of e-coin, and I don't know much about that sort of thing.
* There's also mention of Epstein there (assume Jeffrey Epstein?) which I can't make much sense of, because I am way out of the loop.

Most of the threads there read like conspiracy theory weasel words to me (e.g. ""we have to work for it"") so I'm unsure whether this is an actual thing that has happened, or another made up pizza gate rabbit hole.

Conspiracy thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/or3wyr/accessing_mcafee_files_megathread_get_in_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/or3wyr/accessing_mcafee_files_megathread_get_in_here/)

NOT_MCAFEE,[Highlight] [OC] NFL's Greatest Moments of the 2010s: Pat McAfee recovers his own onside kick (2014 Week 6),
MCAFEE,McAfee is running a scam. Siteadvisor.com is just a fucking ploy by McAfee to sell expensive $360/year hacker safe badges to webmasters (details inside). I need your advice reddit. What are my options when dealing with such a big company?,"Ok, I run a website design site. On 2009 February, McAfee’s siteadvisor.com flagged one of my sites as “not safe” and anyone with McAfee virus scanner or toolbar is now told it has a virus and is blocked from visiting it (existing users have emailed me daily about this too).

What actually happened is they basically pulled links to all executable files on my hosting. They then run it via their virus scanner with heuristic scanning turned ON. What this basically means is that any file which McAfee scanner ""thinks"" is a virus is now flagged as one. Anyway, so they found a file on my domain and tagged it as virus called “Search threat library”. Their result is based on guesswork because it says on the page: “In our tests, this download contained programs **some people** would consider adware, spyware or other potentially unwanted programs.” Thank you, that’s not vague at all! Now the reason I know this file *cannot* be a virus is because I compiled it myself (with *Delphi*) and was not a public download either.

So, I wrote to them, their support told me they’ll re-scan my website. I waited patiently for weeks but the flag was not removed. Being a small webmaster, I said fuck it and I just deleted the file from my server this time (to a 404 page). Wrote to them again (this was few months ago). They did not even reply this time. I emailed them a few more times to finally get another canned reply that my site will be queued again for scanning. I patiently waited for weeks again but nothing happened. So now I am basically being punished for something I **never** did and a file which *doesn't even exist* on my server for the last six months. 

Then one day it suddenly hit me.. You see the thing is McAfee siteadvisor.com also sells these hacker-safe certificates to websites for $360 / year. With that in picture, this whole fucking thing just makes sense. This is just a ploy to sell those certificates. In internet-speak, this is how it works:

    * Find and flag random files as a generic virus (based on some guesswork scanning)
    * Flag the entire domain for hosting viruses and start blocking visitors to it.
    * Domain owner buys *hacker-safe* certificates for an inane $360/year to get site re-tested.
    * Profit!

My option now is to either buy their $360 hacker-safe badge or keep losing more business everyday.. I’m a small webmaster, even if they turn 10 people away daily, it hurts me bad :( I do not have the resources to hire a lawyer or send them legal notices either.

So, I can buy their stupid certificate but I have been **waiting patiently since 2009 February** to resolve this and being strong armed into buying their stupid certificate after all this time will be so fucking very unfair. So I'm posting here as my last ditch attempt. 

I'm desperate for ideas, Reddit. What are my options? Please help me.. 

**edit:** I can see this on the front page. woohoo! Hopefully someone from McAfee will see it now and reply. Also I don't mind if a blogger wants to contact me for more details to write about this little scam too. I've also emailed all details to *AHhHhh_shit* and he has also been a lot of help. My site has been listed on McAfee ever since 2009 Feb and finally i'm beginning to see some hope that someone will at least hear my case! Thank you again Reddit for being awesome. 

**edit 2:** the editors of two leading tech blogs  just contacted me for details last night (replying now). Also, a lot of people have replied (or PMed me) with their own sites and similar stories which only makes me happy that this is finally getting some attention. I wrote to McAfee again (as per turnipsoup's advise) but it will take two business days before we hear from them. I am amazed with the advice and help Reddit has offered me. I will definitely post an update too if something happens.

**edit 3:** my site is finally green again.. woohoo! reddit did it. Everyone who mailed/contacted McAfee on my behalf thank you! I have waited almost an year for this to happen and you guys did it in less than 2 days. I really can't thank you guys enough for your support. I'm feeling very happy and very proud to be a part of this awesome community. This proves that reddit > mcafee.. actually reddit > everything. and redditors are awesome!"
MCAFEE,Earth Successfully Uninstalls McAfee,
MCAFEE,"At this point, it's obvious McAfee is just capitalizing on his name to pump shitcoins and cash out.","This guy was somehow given magical powers: every time he tweets about a coin, it goes to the moon.  
He uses it on nebulous coins with no proven teams nor product like Verge, Burst etc ...

His tweets and insights are no better than your typical reddit crypto bug (""hodl"", ""coins on sale"", ""I am not shilling, this will change the world"" etc ...).
He brings no insight, no perspective, he is just purely shilling BS, and it's working.

I think he understood the crypto game well and uses his name to the fullest.

Edit : it's even worse than I thought, just scroll throigh his latest tweets, you will find his ""due diligence"" on Electroneum. It's embarassing.  
He also tweeted that he read all the whitepapers out there (please..)"
MCAFEE,McAfee is refusing its fate,
NOT_MCAFEE,[video] Pat McAfee digs up old footage of his own show where Joe Thomas states that he wants to be considered as the interim HC for the Browns,
NOT_MCAFEE,"The banter between Cole, Graves, and McAfee during Dominik’s entrance is fn hilarious",
NOT_MCAFEE,I think I figured out a way to crack McAfee's dead man switch,"If you follow the routes of the transactions that are moving, some parts of the transactions appear to be failing due to not enough funds?

If you notice, the transactions that fail have a name attached to them. I think this is on purpose and is a way to help separate the wheat from the chaff. In reality, there's no reason for these transactions to fail where all the others go through without issue... unless they were designed to fail on purpose.

What if that's the secret? The transactions that matter were intentionally designed to fail (and thus flag themselves) inside of this literal mountain of data.

Essentially, focus on the transactions that fail in order to try and make sense of this."
NOT_MCAFEE,McAfee was stunned again. RIP,
