Seems to think Colts have a few offers and are going to take the best one which he believes is going to be a 2nd rd pick and maybe a little more.

Interesting to hear it all. Shocking to me because I was still firmly in the mindset that JT ends up staying from what we've heard so far. But I do have a little more faith  in Rapoport than I do Holder."

We are finally moving away from McAfee Enterprise and are uninstalling it from our servers.  
For some reason not all of the services are being removed.

McAfee Service Controller,  
McAfee Firewall Core Service and  
McAfee Validation Trust Protection Service are still there.

I cannot get them removed. From the services console, I get an access denied. When I try it through the registry (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services) I get an access denied as well.  
It is not possible (as far as I have tried) to change the permissions on the services and program files or gain ownership. I tried running the commandline as SYSTEM (psexec -i -s cmd.exe), still access denied.  
I tried some consumer tools to remove it. From McAfee: MCPR.exe, did not work because it's for consumer products only. I tried ESET AV remover, did not work.  
For now, the only thing that does work is to start the server in save mode and remove the registry keys manually. I truly hope that there is a better way to accomplish this and hope that someone knows that way and is willing to share it with me.

Thanks! (a lot!)

NOT_MCAFEE,The McAfee Dead Mans Switch has been located. Soon it will be decrpyted! Here is what to expect:,"So it turns out Madman McAffe truly did upload insurance files to be released in the case of his death. 31 terabytes! Thats a lot of information. McAfee, who unsuccessfully tried to get the Libertarian Party nomination in the last two election cycles, worked as a programmer for the Apollo missions and, of course, started the McAfee antivirus software, leaving the company in the 90s.   

I expect this file dump to be decrypted in the next 72 hours.What kind of information could it have?

On his own blog McAfee stated:  
 

\> I purchased 75 cheap laptop computers and, with trusted help, installed invisible keystroke logging software on all of them‚Äîthe kind that calls home (to me) and disgorges the text files. It also, on command, turns on, and off, the microphone and camera‚Äîand sends these files on command. I had the computers re-packaged as if new. I began giving these away as presents to select people‚Äîgovernment employees, police officers, Cabinet Minister‚Äôs assistants, girlfriends of powerful men, boyfriends of powerful women. I hired four trusted people full time to monitor the text files and provide myself with the subsequent passwords for everyone‚Äôs e-mail, Facebook, private message boards, and other passworded accounts. The keystroke monitoring continued after password collection, in order to document text input that would later be deleted. So nothing was missed.

\> I next collected my human resources for the complex social engineering I would have to do. I arranged with 23 women and six men to be my operatives. Eight of the women were so accomplished that they ended up living with me. It was amazingly more efficient and they were easily convinced to check up on each other. One was so accomplished (Marcia) that she became a double agent and nearly got me killed.

So this is what we are about to get! The private information of a lot of powerful people. We do indeed live in interesting times :)

At a minimum, we are about to see that the elite are generally psychopaths and governments are completely corrupt, on a scale much greater than any previous information release. At maximum, we might get proof of elite child trafficking and pedophile rings.

Now, this information release is going to trigger some major events and shifts

I want to preface the following analysis with saying that politics and even deep politics are bullshit, it is the entertainment division of the shadow government and everything is staged.  

With that in mind, we can see that the psychopath parasites are planning to put some special spin. There is a McAfee account on telegram posting a lot of Qanon related content. This is a psyop. When the information is released, it will be censored on all major platforms and the official story is that it is just a Qanon conspiracy. To explain the information, they will say it was manufactured by Russia.  

Qanon was created in the first place to discredit the very real conspiracy of elite child trafficking among the sleeping populace, so they don‚Äôt look into it further.

I anticipate the information being damning enough that the psychopath parasites (PP s) will need to stage a false flag attack to dominate the news cycle. This time, I don‚Äôt anticipate it being blamed on middle eastern terrorists, but domestic terrorists. The alleged perpetrator will be described as a Qanon nut.  

This will be the pretext to initiate a new war on domestic terror. There goal is to put militarized police in the streets to take lockdowns to a new level. They will bring in a new era of censorship with the pretext that ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù, aka information not approved by the state, leads to violence and must be eliminated at all costs.

They will also shift to heating up the cold war with Russia, both with rhetoric and operations. They hope to keep people afraid by giving them enemies on all fronts. Qanon, Russia, Covid. Qanon followers will be afraid of the new militarized police getting them. Either way the PPs benefit.

We must do our best to spread awareness of the psychopathic control system so their agenda doesn‚Äôt work.  

What are your thoughts? Mine is:

Buckle up!

Love vibes to all,

He was sitting at the edge of the cliffs past McAfee with his feet on a lower rock, not right on the edge, not posing for a photo, and not on the knob itself. He spontaneously slumped forwards and fell. He was totally well, just chilling eating breakfast. We think he must have passed out, but we don‚Äôt know why and will never know for sure.

He was our friend, and the most lively, empathetic, personable, fun and goofy guy you could ever meet. If you met him on the trail I‚Äôm sure you will remember him. We have set up an email address if you have any photos or stories you would like to share about him, these will all be sent on to his family. Stories.grandmaster@gmail.com. He will be incredibly missed. Thank you all for keeping his family in your thoughts

MCAFEE,McAfee is running a scam. Siteadvisor.com is just a fucking ploy by McAfee to sell expensive $360/year hacker safe badges to webmasters (details inside). I need your advice reddit. What are my options when dealing with such a big company?,"Ok, I run a website design site. On 2009 February, McAfee‚Äôs siteadvisor.com flagged one of my sites as ‚Äúnot safe‚Äù and anyone with McAfee virus scanner or toolbar is now told it has a virus and is blocked from visiting it (existing users have emailed me daily about this too).

What actually happened is they basically pulled links to all executable files on my hosting. They then run it via their virus scanner with heuristic scanning turned ON. What this basically means is that any file which McAfee scanner ""thinks"" is a virus is now flagged as one. Anyway, so they found a file on my domain and tagged it as virus called ‚ÄúSearch threat library‚Äù. Their result is based on guesswork because it says on the page: ‚ÄúIn our tests, this download contained programs **some people** would consider adware, spyware or other potentially unwanted programs.‚Äù Thank you, that‚Äôs not vague at all! Now the reason I know this file *cannot* be a virus is because I compiled it myself (with *Delphi*) and was not a public download either.

So, I wrote to them, their support told me they‚Äôll re-scan my website. I waited patiently for weeks but the flag was not removed. Being a small webmaster, I said fuck it and I just deleted the file from my server this time (to a 404 page). Wrote to them again (this was few months ago). They did not even reply this time. I emailed them a few more times to finally get another canned reply that my site will be queued again for scanning. I patiently waited for weeks again but nothing happened. So now I am basically being punished for something I **never** did and a file which *doesn't even exist* on my server for the last six months. 

Then one day it suddenly hit me.. You see the thing is McAfee siteadvisor.com also sells these hacker-safe certificates to websites for $360 / year. With that in picture, this whole fucking thing just makes sense. This is just a ploy to sell those certificates. In internet-speak, this is how it works:

    * Find and flag random files as a generic virus (based on some guesswork scanning)
    * Flag the entire domain for hosting viruses and start blocking visitors to it.
    * Domain owner buys *hacker-safe* certificates for an inane $360/year to get site re-tested.
    * Profit!

My option now is to either buy their $360 hacker-safe badge or keep losing more business everyday.. I‚Äôm a small webmaster, even if they turn 10 people away daily, it hurts me bad :( I do not have the resources to hire a lawyer or send them legal notices either.

So, I can buy their stupid certificate but I have been **waiting patiently since 2009 February** to resolve this and being strong armed into buying their stupid certificate after all this time will be so fucking very unfair. So I'm posting here as my last ditch attempt. 

I'm desperate for ideas, Reddit. What are my options? Please help me.. 

**edit:** I can see this on the front page. woohoo! Hopefully someone from McAfee will see it now and reply. Also I don't mind if a blogger wants to contact me for more details to write about this little scam too. I've also emailed all details to *AHhHhh_shit* and he has also been a lot of help. My site has been listed on McAfee ever since 2009 Feb and finally i'm beginning to see some hope that someone will at least hear my case! Thank you again Reddit for being awesome. 

**edit 2:** the editors of two leading tech blogs  just contacted me for details last night (replying now). Also, a lot of people have replied (or PMed me) with their own sites and similar stories which only makes me happy that this is finally getting some attention. I wrote to McAfee again (as per turnipsoup's advise) but it will take two business days before we hear from them. I am amazed with the advice and help Reddit has offered me. I will definitely post an update too if something happens.

**edit 3:** my site is finally green again.. woohoo! reddit did it. Everyone who mailed/contacted McAfee on my behalf thank you! I have waited almost an year for this to happen and you guys did it in less than 2 days. I really can't thank you guys enough for your support. I'm feeling very happy and very proud to be a part of this awesome community. This proves that reddit > mcafee.. actually reddit > everything. and redditors are awesome!"

My experience with McAfee has been pretty negative, especially lately. My laptop is a gaming laptop so should be able for high intensity processes (correct me if I'm wrong!) and today McAfee ran a scan than took my CPU up to 100%, and CPU temp up to 90¬∞C. I'm done. Not paying for this anymore, and I hear Defender is good enough. Is it?

Also, I hear getting rid of McAfee is a pain, that up get spammed with pop ups and stuff if you just let it expire and/or don't uninstall properly. Some people online say they've been sent viruses. Any truth to this? If so, how do I safely remove McAfee from my laptop and my life?

NOT_MCAFEE,McAfee‚Äôs dividend will make us RICH,"Listen here retards, I have a play which will make your wife‚Äôs boyfriend so hard he will finally take a turn with you

McAfee announced a special dividend of $4.50 per share which is INSANE considering the stock is only $29

As we get closer to August 13th, the stock will go up as people buy shares to get that dividend. Options are cheap and this has not even been priced in since the stock has only gone up 81 cents since the announcement!

McAfee's stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of 450,000 shares. A higher trading day of 900,000 shares made this thing go up almost 7%! If people start buying heavy for the dividend, this thing will go to the MOOON

This play doesn‚Äôt require McAfee to have solid fundamentals or any other boomer r/investing words, it just takes advantage of people being greedy and buying in to get the dividend.

My strategy is to buy a mix of $25, $30, and $35 call options and sell these before August 13th because people will sell their shares after they are eligible for the $4.5 dividend.

My positions:

8 25c, 10 30c, 3 35c, 3 25p (all expiring 8/20)

But I cannot get it to work. It runs sucessfully if McAfee is not on the system targeted but if it is it fails with just a non-descriptive error code (0x80070001) if McAfee is on the system targeted.

Usually I would flatten the PC - but these are AutoPilot devices so that isn't really feasible. Plus there's about 250 of them. Now it's displaying pop-ups on the devices asking them to renew their McAfee licence so it needs to die.

Please help, how can I blast it away.

Edit 2: I think I've got it to work. Looks like not all the data files copied across that mccleaner needs so probably my fault. I'm using the mccleanup tool from 2021 from archive.org as the newer versions seem to prevent silently running it.

Followed the below guide and script. Just testing it via an Intune Win32 package now which seems to be whirring away (mccleanup.exe is taking like 50% of the CPU).

What problem does it solve better than any of the top 10, what is it's purpose, and why is it worth what it is worth?

Now, besides all that, the coin was literally hacked last week, and the price of it was actually still going up... in a fucking bear market.

MCAFEE,"So no one else finds it a bit odd that Verge is actually going up in price in a bear market, after a hack attack, after being outed for paying McAfee to promote it, and after the 1 developer begged for money from his own community to allegedly help pay his taxes?","First off, before I begin... Verge is a shitcoin.

What problem does it solve better than any of the top 10, what is it's purpose, and why is it worth what it is worth?

If you can't answer these questions honestly, then it is in fact... a shitcoin.

Now, besides all that, the coin was literally hacked last week, and the price of it was actually still going up... in a fucking bear market. Now come on, even if you jerk off to this coin, and spread its greatness all around the interwebs, even you have to admit that it's a bit fucking suspicious right?

Then, the sole developer, living in his moms basement, allegedly, with a bit too much hair on his neck, allegedly, has the ball to tell his community, that he will release news on the ""biggest partnership in cryptocurrency history"" if... you give him millions of dollars.... to pay his taxes... allegedly.

And then he goes ahead, and changes the big announcement date to the 17th of April, which so happens to be the exact day all United States taxes are due... coincidence?

I mean I wish I was making this shit up people, but are people really this fucking dumb, or is the developer actually being trolled himself, and these so called investors are actually just 4Channers waiting to pump and dump this thing like nothing ever seen before?

That's the only explanation I could come up with, that or the whole thing is being manipulated by team McAfee, hence the original push... what say you guys?"
